<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, everyone except Phoebe is there as Rachel enters
carrying a magazine.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, I&#146;m in my apartment doing the <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>
crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to
Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (reading) Three down, <i>Days Of Our Lives</i> star blank Tribbiani.
That&#146;s me!! I&#146;m blank!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How cool is this?! We know three down! I&#146;m touching three down!
(She has her hand on his shoulder.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah you are baby.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Three down knows I&#146;m married, what&#146;s three down doin&#146;?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So did they call you to tell you your name&#146;s gonna be in this?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,
but I said no.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why&#146;d you say no?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I
write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down
the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> If <b>only</b> there was something in your head to control the things
you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus
y&#146;know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And
if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don&#146;t know, gal pal Rachel Green?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, don&#146;t listen to him. Please?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine! All right, I&#146;ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next
table so you can stop me if I y&#146;know, start to say something stupid.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just then or-or all the time, &#145;cause we-we have jobs y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal
Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I&#146;m gonna be in <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>! And not just
in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is there for his interview and everyone but Phoebe are
hiding on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.</p>

<p>[Cut to the rest of the gang sitting low on the couch and craning their necks to watch
the interview.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) You think we&#146;re being obvious?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, we&#146;re just four people with neck problems. You talk like
this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the interview.]</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> (To Joey) Y&#146;know I think its great you wanted to meet
here. Y&#146;know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a
big fancy restaurant.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs) Actually, I didn&#146;t know the magazine was paying for it.
Wouldn&#146;t have mattered, I&#146;m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.</p>

<p><strong>Gunther:</strong> Can I get you anything?</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Umm, I&#146;ll have a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And I&#146;ll have all the muffins.</p>

<p>[Cut to the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Shhh! We&#146;re not talking.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the interview.]</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> So, according to your bio, you&#146;ve done quite a bit of work
before <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Anything you&#146;re particularly proud of?</p>

<p>[This starts a series of flashbacks; the first one is from Episode 106: The One With
The Butt, Joey is in a play called Freud!.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> (He goes into a song and dance number) </p>
<em>

<blockquote>
  <p>All you want is a dingle,<br>
  What you envy's a schwang,<br>
  A thing through which you can tinkle,<br>
  Or play with, or simply let hang...</p>
</blockquote>
</em>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 304: The One With The Metaphorical Tunnel, Joey is on
Amazing Discoveries.]</p>
<b>

<p>Host:</b> Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a
nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and
these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the
counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!</p>
<b>

<p>Mike:</b> And there is Kevin.</p>

<p>[Cut forward.]</p>
<b>

<p>Mike:</b> This is the first time he&#146;s ever used this product, he's never used this
product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin'
starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you
don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts
to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.</p>

<p>(The crowd ahhs.)</p>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 322: The One With The Screamer, it&#146;s the end of
Joey&#146;s play.]</p>
<b>

<p>Lauren:</b> So this is it? Victor?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Yeah, I guess it is. And so&#133; I&#146;m gonna get on this
spaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with
flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I&#146;m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search
of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you&#146;ll be long gone. But
I won&#146;t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your
great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne&#133; baby&#133;I&#146;m gonna
want to meet her. </p>

<p>(The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7.)</p>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 204: The One With Phoebe&#146;s Husband, when everyone
including Julie is watching Joey in his porno.] </p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I
can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do&#133;so I just watch 'em
have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) <i>you know that's bad for
the paper tray</i>.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b></b> Nice work my friend.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's
butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am&#133;</p>

<p>[Cut to the interview.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there are so many things, it&#146;s hard to pick just one.</p>

<p>[Cut to the gang.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah, I&#146;d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, double latte, extra foam.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And a bagel with only&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (interrupting him) I was just being polite!</p>

<p>[Cut to the interview.]</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Okay, how about when you&#146;re not working. What do you do in
your spare time?</p>

<p>[This starts another series of flashbacks about Joey&#146;s hobbies. The first one is
from Episode 703: The One With Phoebe&#146;s Cookies, Rachel is teaching Joey how to sail
his boat, the Mr. Bowmont.]</p>

bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way
jackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Rachel:</b></b> That <b>is</b> the Coast Guard. </p>

breath for almost four minutes! </p>

<p>(We see Joey who has puffed up his cheeks and Chandler nonchalantly reaches down and
pinches Joey&#146;s nose shut. In a few seconds, Joey has to move because he&#146;s now
forced to actually hold his breath.) </p>

hat.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b></b> Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the
cowboy hat is a little much?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b></b> (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's
fun!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b></b> All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a
bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!</p>

<p>(Chandler does so.)</p>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 417: The One With The Free Porn, Chandler and Joey are

the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y&#146;know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites
his fist to keep from talking.)</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> A mento&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Like the candy?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Matter of fact, I do.</p>

<p>(Chandler tries to jump over the couch but everyone stops him.)</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how
our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.</p>

<p>[Another set of flashbacks begin with Episode 521: The One With The Ball, Joey and Ross
are throwing a ball around.]</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping
it, for like an hour?</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b></b> Are you serious?!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say
anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Ross:</b></b> Wow! We are pretty good at this!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!</p>

lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven&#146;t been able to stand up
since. But um, I don&#146;t think it&#146;s anything serious.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b></b> This sounds like a hernia. You have to&#151;you-you&#151;Go to the
doctor!</p>
<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> No way! &#145;Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything
it&#146;s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows

Damn you 15s!</p>

her desert to Joey and Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b></b> It&#146;s a trifle. It&#146;s got all of these layers. First
there&#146;s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from
scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then
beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something&#146;s wrong.] then
a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!</p>

Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years
ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn&#146;t
have said. But believe me, that&#146;s not gonna happen today.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Understood. So, what&#146;d you say back then?</p>

stomach), who knows? I&#146;m just kidding&#151;Seriously, (leans into the cassette

<p><b>Ross:</b> (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)</p>

is carrying the bag and has entered Central Perk to the amusement of Ross and Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just
looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your
stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Your make-up!</p>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 712: The One Where They&#146;re Up All Night, Joey and
Ross are deciding how to climb down the final part of the fire escape.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we&#146;re face to
face or-or should I climb down your back so we&#146;re-we&#146;re butt to face.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think face to face.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I would say that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Face to face, yeah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, here I go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. </p>

<p>(Ross steps onto the bottom rung of the ladder and then steps on Joey&#146;s chest.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (grunting) Oh my&#133; How much do you weigh Ross?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I prefer not to answer that right now, I&#146;m still carrying a little
holiday weight.</p>

<p>(Ross continues to climb down. He puts his other foot further down on Joey&#146;s
torso, but that doesn&#146;t work very well and he&#146;s forced to wrap his legs around
Joey. Which then forces Joey to get a nice and close view of Ross&#146;s crotch.)</p>

thought it all the way through.</p>

<b>

<p><b>Joey:</b></b> No I&#146;m not. Why would you say that? That&#146;s just mean.</p>
<b>

<p><b>Chandler:</b></b> Now I&#146;ve upset you? What did I say?</p>
<b>

at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the
gang.)</p>

&quot;Hey, how you doin&#146;?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, please!</p>

<p>(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)</p>

<p>[The next one is from Episode 605: The One With Joey's Porsche.]</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She&#146;s sleeping.
(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the

it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate
and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?</p>

so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody
this. Other than <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, what&#146;s your favorite soap opera?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I don&#146;t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y&#146;know?</p>

said you didn&#146;t watch soap operas.</p>
